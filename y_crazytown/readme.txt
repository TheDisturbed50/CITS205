Required Module:
install_prerequisites.bat is there to gather the needed module for this python script.

or, just run the terminal command yourself:
pip install --upgrade pandas

This is the module to interpret CSV and gives us the iteration with greater ease than stdlib 'csv'.

Later on, I'll extract and attach module to source directory to bypass this step.
