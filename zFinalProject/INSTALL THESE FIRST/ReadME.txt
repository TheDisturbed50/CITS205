Beyond these folders lies your fate....




Not really. But if my program is going to do anything for ya, you'll need to run these.

I tried to share the libraries manually, but when I checked my data on another machine, it was a dud.
So many prerequisites, and the internet always leans to reinstall with some of the errors I was getting, 
so I apologize to make you go through all that!

There is a text file in each folder (dependant on version) with the pip commands, I was going to send them as
.bat my windows 10 went into security freakout mode and wiped the files clean. So needy.
